Pod
- Kubernetes doesn’t run containers directly on the nodes. Every container is encapsulated by a pod.
- Smallest unit of Kubernetes
- A pod is a single instance of an application. If another instance of the application needs to be deployed, another pod is deployed with the containerized application running inside it.
- Creates a running environment over the container so that we only interact with the Kubernetes layer. This allows us to replace the container technology like Docker.
- **Each pod gets an internal IP address** for communicating with each other (virtual network created by K8)
- If a pod is restarted (maybe after the application running on it crashed), its IP address may change

Commands for pod
1.To create pod
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

2.To see pods
kubectl get pods

3.To see details of pod
kubectl describe pods

4. Command to create pod-nginx.yaml
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-pod.yaml

To execute 
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml



Config file for a Pod
pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
	  - name: httpd
	    image: httpd:2.4-alpine


# Restart Policy

The default behavior of K8s is to restart a pod if it terminates. This is desirable for long running containers like web applications or databases. But, this is not desirable for short-lived containers such as a container to process an image or run analytics. 

`restartPolicy` allows us to specify when K8s should restart the pod.

- `Always` - restart the pod if it goes down (default)
- `Never` - never restart the pod
- `OnFailure` - restart the pod only if the container inside failed (returned non zero exit code after execution)

# Pod Status and Conditions

## Pod Status

**Pod status tells where the pod is in its lifecycle.
It can be viewed using `kubectl get pods` command ***

- Pending >>  pod is waiting to be scheduled on a node
- ContainerCreating >> pulling the images and starting the containers for the pod
- Running >> the containers inside the pod are running

## Pod Conditions

**Binary values signifying the state of a pod
     It can be viewed by running kubectl describe pod <pod- name> command and looking at the conditions section***

- PodScheduled >> pod has been scheduled on a node
- Initialized >> pod has been initialized
- ContainersReady >> containers inside the pod are ready to run
- Ready >> pod is ready to run (when all the containers inside the pod are ready to run)


## Multi-container pods
      are used in cases where it’s better to have separate code for some added functionality along with the application code. 
        Example: log agent alongside the application to collect logs and send them to a centralized log server.
 Containers inside a pod share the same:
    - Lifecycle - created and destroyed together
    - Network - can refer each other as localhost
    - Storage - can access the same storage volumes
- All the containers inside a pod must keep running for the pod to remain in running state. If any of them fails, the pod restarts
