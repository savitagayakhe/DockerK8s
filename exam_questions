1. Check the no of schedulable nodes and write no to a file, excluding tainted nodes
2. Scale deployment to 4 replicas
3. Create nw policy that allows access from nginx pod in dev namespace to redis pod in test namespace.
4.Expose deployment as nodeport service on port 8080
5. perform etcd backup on cluster on /etc/backup, once done restore backup using backup file given in /var/lib/etcd_bkp
6. Create cluster role, cluster role binding and service account, cluster role that allows deployment, service and ds to be created in namespace test
7. Make node unschedulable and move traffic to other nodes
8. Create ingress resource
9. Create pod and schedule it on node worker01
10. Monitor logs of pod and look for error-not-found and redirect message to a file
11. Check for pod that have lable env=abc and redirect the pod name with highest cpu utilization to a file
12. Create multicontainer pod with image redis and memcache
13. Edit pod and add initcontainer with busybox image 
14. In cluster with worker node in NotReady state, fix cluster by ssh into worker node (make sure changes are permanent)
