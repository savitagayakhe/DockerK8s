Docker networking

By default 3 networks are created by docker engine
1. Bridge:- Default nw for all containers 
          - private internal nw (usually series 172.17.0.0)
          - Containers can talk to each other using IP
          - To access container from external(outside) nw we must map host port with containers port
          


2. Host:- To access container from external nw use host network by containers
        - NO need to map port no. as it automatically uses host nw
        - No isolation between Docker host and Container
        - e.g. to access web container of port no 8000 directly using host add:8000 we can access it 
         - Cant run multiple web containers on same host with same port no.
          

3. None:- Containers are not attached to any network; run in isolated nw
        - Hence no access/communication with other containers or external nw
        

Docker create only one bridge nw by default; If we need some containers in another(custom) nw 
we need to create nw 

To cretae nw using bridge driver and name as mynetwork
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 192.168.100.0/24 mynetwork

To list all nw
docker network ls


To get details about network 
docker network inspect network_id

** we can connect single container to multiple nw
To connect nw to container
docker network connect network_name container_name

To disconnect container from nw
docker network disconnect network_name container_name


Containers talk to each other using there(container) names
>> Docker uses DNS(embedded) 
>> containers resolves each-other using DNS(with container_names)
>> this DNS generally works at 127.0.0.1 address 


** containers created with user-defined nw can communicate(ping) wih each other
   >> same thing with default bridge nw is not possible


TASK >> create a network with name mynet and subnet 192.168.100.0/16
      Create 2 containers 
      try to execute ping command from both containers pinging another using name
     >> it works due to /etc/resolve.conf >> DNS (127.0.0.11)
for pinging may be iputils-ping package required to install in containers

 
for reference    
https://docs.docker.com/network/#dns-services

To connect existing container to custom nw
docker network connect network_name container_name
** container can connect multiple networks


To see which containers connected to network
docker inspect nw_name
>> endpoints are container

Stop and remove containers connected and then we can remove network

To remove/delete network
docker network rm network_name

To remve all unused nw
docker network prune
