1) Find the pod that consumes the most CPU in all namespace(including kube-system) in all cluster(currently we have single cluster). Then, store the result in the file high_cpu_pod.txt with the following format: pod_name,namespace .

Run top command for pod (for all pods under all namespaces)

kubectl top pods --all-namespaces 

If asked for sort use below command

kubectl top pods --sort-by=cpu or mem --all-namespaces

store the output in file- high_cpu_pod.txt with the following format: pod_name,namespace

How to format store?

2) Create a Kubernetes Pod configuration to facilitate real-time monitoring of a log file. Specifically, you need to set up a Pod named alpine-pod-pod that runs an Alpine Linux container.

Requirements:

Name the Pod alpine-pod-pod
Use alpine:latest image
Container name alpine-container
Configure the container to execute the tail -f /config/log.txt command(using args ) with /bin/sh (using command ) to continuously monitor and display the contents of a log file.

Created alpine pod is going in "Completed" status or ImagePullBackoff.
